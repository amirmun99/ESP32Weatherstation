# (GPT) Software install guide:

This guide will walk you through the software setup required for the ESP32-Powered Weather Station project. You will need to install several software tools and libraries, and then upload (flash) the provided code to your ESP32 board.

**Prerequisites**

Basic knowledge of electronics and programming.
Access to a computer with an internet connection.

**Step 1:** Install Arduino IDE
The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is used for writing and uploading code to the ESP32 board.

Download Arduino IDE: Visit the Arduino Software page and download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux).

Install Arduino IDE: Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation instructions.

**Step 2:** Install ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE

After installing the Arduino IDE, you need to add support for the ESP32 board.

Open Arduino IDE.
Go to File > Preferences.
In the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field, enter the following URL:

https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

Click "OK".

Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager.

In the Boards Manager, search for "ESP32" and install the latest version of the "ESP32 by Espressif Systems".

**Step 3:** Install Required Libraries
Several libraries are needed for this project, including those for the TFT display and JSON parsing.

Open Arduino IDE.

Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.

In the Library Manager, search for and install the following libraries:

*  Adafruit GFX Library 

* Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library

* ArduinoJson

**Step 4:**  Prepare the Code

Download the Project Code: The code for the ESP32 Weather Station can be found on the project's GitHub page.

Extract the downloaded code to a known location on your computer.

**Step 5:** Configure the Code
Open the Arduino IDE.

Open the downloaded code (File > Open and navigate to the code location).

Modify the code to include your WiFi credentials and OpenWeatherMap API key.

**Step 6:** Connect the ESP32 to Your Computer

Using a Micro USB cable, connect the ESP32 board to your computer.

**Step 7:** Flash the Code to the ESP32

In the Arduino IDE, select the correct board and port:

Go to Tools > Board and select "ESP32 Dev Module".

Go to Tools > Port and select the port that your ESP32 is connected to.

Click the upload button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to the ESP32.

**Step 8:** Verify Operation

Once the code is uploaded:

The ESP32 will attempt to connect to WiFi.

Upon successful connection, it will fetch weather data and display it on the TFT screen.


Troubleshoot any issues by checking the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE (Tools > Serial Monitor).
Support and Troubleshooting

For additional support and troubleshooting, refer to the project's GitHub repository or the Arduino community forums.

By following these steps, your ESP32-Powered Weather Station should be up and running, providing real-time weather updates. Enjoy your journey into the world of IoT and embedded programming!
